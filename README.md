It's like [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) but simpler. Made for sake of education.

Goals:
* add
* remove
* sort by:
** date added
** name
* data persistance (between browser refresh)
* contacts should be grouped
* support for only latest features
* keep it KISS as possible
* focus on JS, don't care about view layer

Implementations:
* [Simple Vanilla JS](/vanilla-js-simple)
